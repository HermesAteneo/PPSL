# PPSL - Protected Public Source License

![PPSL - Protected Public Source License](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1800/1*zBRx2dEN_GFlKIglEwTl3A.png) 

License for any type of computer coding where the source is public but rights protected

Due to the precariousness of the currently existing licenses for code and software, which do not give a valid alternative to blockchain + web3 based businesses where the publication of the code becomes necessary so that any user can validate the reliability of the project, we created a new type of license for public code with copyright.

# Specifications

- Uncompiled code is public to check business reliability
- Code can be used for learning and research
- Code cannot be replicated for commercial activities unrelated to the original code bussiness
- Code can be replicated for commercial activities that participate in the benefits of the original code bussiness

# Version

Protected Public Source License - PPSL v.10
